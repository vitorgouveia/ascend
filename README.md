# Features

### Columns

Columns group tasks into a context, each column has it's own context.
For Example: Personal Projects, Work and College.

Columns have an icon and a title, both can be edited.

/>

Columns can also be deleted.

> But there's no way to create them back yet.

### Tasks

Tasks group various subtasks together, and represent a chunk of work.

Tasks can be created, deleted, blocked (I'll touch on that later).

Tasks titles can also be edited.

### Subtasks

Subtasks represent the smallest unit of work.

Subtasks can be created in tasks, checked, unchecked and blocked.

Blocking a task means that progress dependps on some external person or resource that isn't available now, and if the subtask is blocked we cannot progress on the task itself, forcing a skip to the next available task of that column or the next one.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  A[Current Task] --> B{Is It Blocked?};
  B -- Yes --> C[Jump to next non-blocked task in column or next column]
  B -- No --> D[Keep working until finished or blocked]
  C ----> E[Enjoy unlimited productivity!]
  D ----> E[Enjoy unlimited productivity!]
```
